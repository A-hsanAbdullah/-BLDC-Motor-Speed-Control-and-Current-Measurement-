ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project for **Embedded Systems 2**! 

**Project Title: Investigating BLDC Motor Speed Control and Current Measurement using Machine Learning to Analyze the Relationship Between Duty Cycle and RPM**

**Project Description:**
In this project, I developed a comprehensive system to investigate and control the speed of a BLDC motor while integrating machine learning for predictive analysis. The motor speed was adjusted using a potentiometer, and real-time RPM was measured using a Hall Effect sensor. Additionally, current consumption was monitored using a current sensor. The objective was to analyze the relationship between motor speed and current consumption, as well as predict RPM based on the duty cycle. The collected data was transmitted via UART to VS Code, where it was further processed and visualized using Tkinter for graphical representation. A key highlight of this project was the application of machine learningâ€”specifically, a Logistic Regression model trained to predict the motor RPM based on duty cycle input. This fusion of hardware interfacing with data-driven predictions enhanced both the precision and the adaptability of the motor control system.
